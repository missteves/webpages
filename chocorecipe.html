	<h3>Method</h3>
	<ol>
	<li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4</li>
	<li>Line two baking sheets with parchment.</li>
	<li>Cream the butter and sugars together until very light and fluffy, then beat in the egg and vanilla. Once combined, stir in the flour, bicarb, chocolate and ¼ tsp salt.</li>
	<li>Scoop 10 large tbsps of the mixture onto the trays, leaving enough space between each to allow for spreading.</li>
	<li>Bake for 10-12 mins or until firm at the edges but still soft in the middle – they will harden a little as they cool.</li>
	<li>Leave to cool on the tray for a few mins before eating warm, or transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Will keep for three days in an airtight container.</li>
	</ol>
