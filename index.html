	Our Mission <br/><br/>
	At ACE of BRUSSELS we develop and nurture academic and personal excellence in each of our students through learning,
	discovery, questioning and creativity.  Our blend of traditional and modern teaching, together with our use of technology, 
	allows us to provide individualised programmes of study according to the needs of our students. 
	
	Our goal is to inspire a lifelong love of learning through exploration and discovery.  
	Our curriculum focuses on the whole child, so that our students leave our community as well-rounded and confident young people who are ready to face lifeâ€™s challenges.
