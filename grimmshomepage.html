  <h1 align="center">Grimm's Fairy Tales</h1>
<p>This book contains 209 tales collected by the brothers Grimm.
The exact print source is unknown. The etext appears to be based on the translation by Margaret Hunt called Grimm's Household Tales, but it is not identical to her edition. (Some of the translations are slightly different, the arrangement also differs, and the Grimm's scholarly notes are not included.)</p>

<p>The etext received by the Universal Library did not include story titles. They have been restored in this edition, based on Hunt's titles. (Thanks also to Steve Nickolas for restoring the end of the last tale in this version.)</p>

<p>Note that these tales are presented more or less as the Grimms collected and edited them (and as Hunt saw fit to translate them). Readers of these versions may find more violence and crudity (and occasional anti-Semitism) than in the retellings that are more familiar to most modern readers. For more about the Grimms and their work, see this page at the University of Pittsburgh. </p>

<p>NEW: There is now a more accurate version of the Hunt translation posted by William Barker. We suggest you use those texts instead of these. We may remove this page (or these texts) in the future, in preference to the more accurate Hunt edition.</p>
