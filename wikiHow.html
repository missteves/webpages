		<p style="width:800px">A well-made model building can complete a diorama for a school project, add background detail to a model train set, or help you previsualize a complex construction project. Piecing together your own model buildings is easier than you might think—in most cases, all you need is a plan and a few simple, inexpensive materials. Start by drafting up a basic design for your building, then trace its individual planes onto your material of choice and cut them out by hand. Once you’ve prepared each of your separate components, all that’s left to do is glue them together and add the finishing touches.</p>

			<li><b>Decide what kind of building you want to make.</b> Before you actually begin putting together your model building, you need to have a clear sense of what it will look like. Take note of different types of buildings while you’re out and about to get inspiration and refine your mental image, or use your imagination to come up with your own one-of-a-kind structure. If you can envision it, you can build it.
			<ul>
			<li>If you plan on modeling a real building, take plenty of photographs so you’ll have something to refer to throughout the design phase.</li>
			<li>A simple house, barn, or other traditional structure will be the easiest to create on your first attempt. As your skills improve, you might try your hand at elaborate mansions, skyscrapers, castles, and other types of buildings.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
			<b>Sketch your building from multiple angles.</b> Sit down with a pencil and a sheet of paper and create a rough rendering of your building showing what it will look like from each side. Make sure you include at least one view of the roof, along with any other prominent design features.[2]
			<ul>
			 <li>Drawing your building will enable you to visualize it more clearly. It will also help you transfer the structure’s individual planes onto your work materials once the time comes.</li>
			<li>Your sketch doesn’t have to be perfect—it will just serve as a preliminary visual aid to guide you through the process of cutting and assembling your model building’s various pieces.</li>
			</ul>

	<li>
	<b>Scale your model to the appropriate size if you’re recreating an actual structure.</b> To build a miniaturized replica with accurate dimensions and proportions, start by finding the height and width of the building you want to model. Once you’ve done that, pull up a modeling scale conversion chart online and use the figures listed to translate your recorded measurements to a given scale, which you’ll then use to build your model.[3]
		<ul>
		<li>Scales are represented as fractions that indicate how big a model is in comparison to the object it’s based on. If you’re building your model to a 1/125 scale, for instance, it means that it would take 125 of your model lined up end-to-end to equal the length of the actual building.[4]</li>
		<li>You may be able to look up the exact dimensions of a given structure in your local building records. Run a quick search for "building records" plus the name of your town or city and the name or address of the building you’re looking for to pull up its original building plans.</li>
		</ul>

		<li>
		<b>Trace each individual plane of your building onto a sheet of heavy cardstock.</b> Now that you know what you want your building to look like and how big you want it to be, it’s time to transfer your designs to your actual work materials. Draw an outline of each of the building’s main components, including the floor, walls, roof, and any outlying features like chimneys, gables, flower boxes or downspouts.[5]
		<ul>
		<li>You can also use styrene, mat board, gel foam, or balsa wood instead of cardstock. Some of these materials may vary in terms of cost and durability, but all are soft enough to cut and shape easily.[6]</li>
		<li>If you want your model building to have openings for doors and windows, be sure to draw them in.</li>
		</ul>
